    <h1>Menu Engineering</h1>
    <p>It's time to optimize your menu for more profits.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Understanding Buyer Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        While you want your menu to be a work of art, it's good to have science
        behind it too. As part of behavioral psychology, it's all about getting
        inside the head of the buyer. Understanding buyer behavior. Big
        restaurant chains, retailers, and online stores really work hard at
        this, and so you should not ignore it.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's both a science and an art to the visual presentation of a menu,
        which also takes into consideration "buyer psychology".
      </p>
      <p>
        We've been lucky enough to have worked with a man who had a 37-year
        career in getting this right for some of the biggest brands in the
        world, generating over $40B (yes, that's billion!) last year alone for
        the industry; Gregg Rapp, The Menu Engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gregg's method, which we deploy in our menu engineering service,
        specializes in creating a powerful menu that positively impacts guests'
        experience, increases total order value, and drives their desire to
        return, making it one of the best investments in your business.
