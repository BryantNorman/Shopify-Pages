    <h3>About Us</h3>

    <p>We are Love & Humphries, the printers behind SuperTuffMenus.</p>

    <p>
      We’ve been printing as a team for more than 20 years. We like to do stuff
      right. We are proud of what we do. We have a product that is unique and we
      want to share it with the world. We do this because we want to make a
      difference. A small but noticeable difference. Yes, we really love our
      food and we have become a wee bit geeky about menus too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why are we doing this? Well, as far as we could see nobody was trying to
      solve the problem of the sticky greasy menu. Yes, there are options out
      there but none quite like this. None actually trying to reduce the number
      of menus being sold. Selling you more menus than you really need is
      admitting the product isn’t very good. Isn’t it? We don’t do that because
      our menus are super tuff!
    </p>

            I ain’t going back (to my old menus)”
